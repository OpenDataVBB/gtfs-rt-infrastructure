# VBB GTFS Realtime feed â€“ Ansible setup

This repo **configures the machines that the [VBB GTFS Realtime (GTFS-RT) feed](https://github.com/OpenDataVBB/gtfs-rt-feed) runs on** using [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html).

## VDV-453 proxy machines

> [!NOTE]
> Ansible group: `vdv_453_proxy`

These two (staging & production) machines will act as "proxies" (in a logical sense, not in a technical sense) between VBB's VDV-453 API and the machines converting the data to GTFS-RT.

They are VPSes hosted at [Planetary Networks](https://www.planetary-networks.de). They can be administered using their [management UI](https://console.planetary-networks.de:8800/).
