# VBB VDV-453 proxy

This repo contains code to set up two (staging & production) "proxy machines".

The aforementioned machines are VPSes hosted as [Planetary Networks](https://www.planetary-networks.de). They can be administered using their [management UI](https://console.planetary-networks.de:8800/).
